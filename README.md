# PETKOVIC

PETKOVIC is a bundle of code I wrote to help me predict WTA matches. It has two main parts. One component trains a model on nearly 1 million match records. The other gathers the data necessary to make these predictions and puts it in a form intelligible to my model. 

I named this project PETKOVIC after Andrea Petkovic, a German tennis player who is notable for her top 10 ranking and love of Goethe. PETKOVIC is also a descriptive backronym: it stands for a (P)rocess for (E)stimating (T)entatively (K)nowledgeable (O)dds from (V)oliminous (I)nternational (C)ompetitions. 

The vast majority of the data I used to train my models was collected by Jeff Sackman. I, and much of the tennis community, are deeply indebted to his work. 

Right now, there is only one file in this repository. It's the Selenium scraper I used to gather data Sackman had not released yet. It's a scrappy little program which requires some human intervention, but it worked for me. 

I'll release more parts of PETKOVIC shortly.
